## Project: EzManager
EZ Manager is a simple and efficient project management tool for software project managers. 
EZ Manager is a desktop application with the user interacting with the CLI 
(Command Line Interface) to manage projects, tasks and team members.

### Summary of Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=samuelchristopher)

* **Features Added**: 
    * **Project View**: Allows the user to have an overview of all the tasks and members in the project.
    * **Create Member (In home view)**: Allows the user to add a member to program.
    * **Delete Project (In home view)**: Allows the user to remove a specified project from the program.

    * **Mark Tasks As Completed**: Allows the user to mark a project as completed.
    * **Storage**: Allows the data on EZ Manager to be persisted.
    
* **Noteworthy Features**: 

1. Added Project View feature.
    * What it does: Allows the user to have an overview of all the tasks and members in the project.
    This includes important information such as:
       - status of the task (is it done or not?)
       - description
       - deadline
       - priority of the task
       - estimated hours to spend on the task
       - actual time spent on the task 
       - members involved with the task
    * Justification: This feature allows our project managers to get a glance of the projects all in one command. 
    Features like this one are essential to allow the project manager to determine of the project is on track.
    
2. Data persistence
    * Allows the data on the system to be saved and loaded in after each session. This makes it convinent for 
    the user and brings the EZ Manager application to life as the user can store the data in a safe and reliable manner.
