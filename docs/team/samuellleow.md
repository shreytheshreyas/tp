### Summary of Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=samuellleow)

* **Features Added**: 
    * **Home View**: Allows the user to have an overview of all the projects and members in the program.
    * **Remove member (In home view)**: Allows the user to remove a specified member from the program entirely.
    * **Remove member (In project view)**: Allows the user to remove a specified member from the current project. 
    * **Add a new Project**: Allows the user to add a new project to the program. 
    * **Add Project Description**: Allows the user to add a project description to a specified project.
    * **Add Project Deadline**: Allows the user to add a deadline to a specified project.
    
* **Noteworthy Feature**: Added home view feature. (Pull Requests #97 and #175)
    * What it does: Allows the user to have an overview of all the projects and members in the program.
    including important information such as description, deadline, tasks completed per project and projects each member is involved in.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the user do not have to type in multiple commands
    to view a list of projects or a list of members separately. An overview could be seen with one command.
    * Highlights: This feature displays remarks of each project, which shows the user the next task with an upcoming deadline.
    If the deadline is within 5 days from today's date, and the task has not been done, "!!!!!WARNING!!!!!" will be displayed in the remarks to alert
    the user.
