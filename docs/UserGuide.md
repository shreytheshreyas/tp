In this view, you can execute task and member commands but
you cannot execute project commands.
- **Project list**: Refers to the list of projects currently
existing in the system
- **Task list**: Refers to the list of tasks currently
existing in the system
- **Member list**: Refers to the list of members currently
existing in the system
- **PROJECT_INDEX**: Every existing project would be assigned
a positive integer. Hence, the PROJECT_INDEX refers to this
positive integer. You can retrieve the PROJECT_INDEXes of 
all projects by using the `list` command in HomeView
- **TASK_INDEX**: Every existing task would be assigned
a positive integer. Hence, the TASK_INDEX refers to this
positive integer. You can retrieve the TASK_INDEXes of 
all tasks by using the `list` command in Project View
- **MEMBER_INDEX**: Every existing member would be assigned
a positive integer. Hence, the MEMBER_INDEX refers to this
positive integer. You can retrieve the MEMBER_INDEXes of 
Members by using the `list` command in Home View or in Project View
