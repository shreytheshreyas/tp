## 3. Home View
As a project manager, you need to have a quick overview of all the projects that are under your charge.
Apart from just projects, you would want to be able to see what your members are working on, so that you can allocate 
work evenly across your members.
The Home View does just that. You get a concise display of the full list of projects and members that are under your purview. 

At a glance, you see the most important details about your project including its status, deadline and number of tasks completed.

The Home View also conveniently provides you with warnings for uncompleted tasks with imminent deadlines.

Remarks shown for each project depends on the deadline of its tasks.
Task that you have not completed and has an upcoming deadline due in 5 days or less will have `!!!Warning!!!` shown in the remarks as well as a countdown to deadline.
Task that you have not completed but has a deadline due in 6 days or more will just have the name of task and date of deadline displayed in the remarks.

## 4.1. Project View Commands

### 4.1.1. Viewing the updated Project View: `list`
When you select a project you might want to view an overview of all the tasks along with their respective priorities and deadlines. You may also be interested in viewing a list of all members associated to the project and which tasks they are working on.
This command allows you to view the Project View of a project and is progressively updated everytime you add in a new task and assign in a member to the project.

Format: `list`

### 4.1.2. Adding a task: `task`
Each project have their own activities and assignments associated with them. To record these activities this command allows you to create a new task and the program adds it to the task list.

### 4.1.6. Adding a priority to a task: `priority` (Sean)
Over time, you discover new bugs add new features and your project starts to fill up with
tasks after tasks. Add priorities to tasks and ensure your team stays focused and work on the most important tasks first. 

All you have to do is specify the task index followed by the priority according to the format below.

> :bulb: 1 denotes the highest priority.
>
> :bulb: EZManager will allow you to easily sort and view these tasks by priority (See: Sort command).
>
> :exclamation: The task must exist before a deadline can be added.

Format: `priority t/TASK_INDEX p/PRIORITY`

:warning: The `PRIORITY` must be a positive integer.

Example of usage: 

> Adds the highest priority, 1, to the first task in the task list.

```
priority t/1 p/1
____________________________________________________________

```

### 4.1.8. Assigning a member to a task: `assign` (Sean)
Easily delegate work to your team members with the assign commmand! 

Now each member knows exactly what they have to do and not be overwhelmed with the full list of tasks in a project. 

Besides, EZManager allows you to assign multiple members to tasks so they can discuss and collaborate with team members 
that are assigned the same task as them! 


> :exclamation: Members must belong to a project before they can be assigned tasks.

Format: `assign t/TASK_INDEX m/MEMBER_INDEX`

* The `TASK_INDEX` must be a positive integer.
* The `MEMBER_INDEX` must be a positive integer.
* The task must exist before it can be assigned a member.

Example of usage: 

> Assigns the first member in the member list to the first task in the task list

```
assign m/1 t/1
____________________________________________________________
Member "Tom" has been assigned to "Code Review"
```

**Examples of Exception Handling for this command**
> Assigning a member to a task that does not exist
```
assign m/1 t/11
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Task ID does not exist!
```
> Assigning a member to a task who is not assigned to the respective project 
```
assign m/4 t/1
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Team Member ID does not exist!
```  


### 4.1.9. Removing a member: `remove` (Sean)
If you decide to remove a member from a project, it's incredibly simple! 

Easily remove a member from a project with the remove command. The member will continue to be part of your members list in
the Home View so you can assign him/her to another project instead.

> :exclamation: The member must exist before they can be removed.

Format: `remove m/MEMBER_INDEX`

Example of usage: 

>  Removes the first member from the member list.

```
remove m/1
___________________________________________________________

```

**Examples of Exception Handling for this command**
> Removing a team member without the m/ parameter
```
remove 2
Certain Parameters are missing!
```
> Removing a team member that was not assigned to the respective project
```
_____________________________________________________________________________________
remove m/3
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Team Member ID does not exist!
_____________________________________________________________________________________
```



### 4.1.10. Add estimated time: `estimate`
As a project manager, you need to ensure that your projects are run profitably. This means that projects cannot 
over-run the timeline that has been agreed with your stakeholders. To ensure that time is spend well, you can add
estimate the amount of time that should be spent on a task. This ensures that your team will have a rough gauge on how
much time they can spend on a task before it becomes unprofitable. 

Apart from maintaining profitability, this allows you to catch red flags early on when tasks require more time than 
what has been forecasted. This gives you ample time to communicate foreseeable delays with your clients and ensure  that 
unwanted surprises are minimised throughout your project management journey.

To add an estimated time, you can use the format shown below.

Format: `estimate t/TASK_INDEX h/HOURS m/MINUTES`

> :warning:  `HOURS` and `MINUTES ` must both be positive numbers.
>


Example usage and output:

```
estimate t/1 h/12 m/30
____________________________________________________________
Task "New Task" has estimated time of 12 hours and 30 minutes

```  
  
---
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>  

**Examples of Exception Handling for this command** (Shreyas)
> Assigning a time period to a task that does not exist
```
estimate t/11 h/6 m/30
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Task ID does not exist!
```


### 4.1.11. Add actual time taken: `actual`
Expectations are different from reality. You may set out to finish a task in one hour but it might end up taking twice 
that much time. Having a record of the actual time that your team members spent on a task is invaluable. This opens up 
the opportunity for you to gauge timelines better in the future. Ensuring that your projects remain profitable.

Here is best part. You can use the records of actual time taken to facilitate reviews with your team. Allowing them to 
learn about the difference between perceived and actual effort needed for tasks.


To add the actual time taken for task to be completed, the format below can be used.

> :exclamation: Task must be marked as done before actual time taken can be added.

Format: `actual t/TASK_INDEX h/HOURS m/MINUTES`

> :warning:  `HOURS` and `MINUTES   `  must both be positive numbers.


Example usage and output:

```
done t/1
actual t/1 h/12 m/30
____________________________________________________________
Task "New Task" took 12 hours and 30 minutes to be completed.

```
**Examples of Exception Handling for this command** (Shreyas)
> Assigning a time period to a task that does not exist
```
actual t/11 h/5 m/20    
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Task ID does not exist!
```

### 4.1.12. Sort tasks: `sort` (Shreyas)

What do you do when you start a week? A meticulous project manager like yourself always plans ahead. The most difficult part
is determining where you and your team should spend their energy. With this sorting feature, you can determine which
tasks you need to focus on at a glance. Simply sort tasks by priority, deadline or actual time taken.

Here are a few things you can take note of:
:bulb: Highest priority of 1 will be displayed at top.

:bulb: Earliest deadline will be displayed at top.

:bulb: Shortest actual time will be displayed at top.

:bulb: Shortest estimated time will be displayed at top.

Format: `sort s/SORTING_TYPE`

* Sorting type `a` refers to actual time, `e` refers to estimated time,  `p` refers to priority and `d` refers to deadline.

Example usage and output:

```
sort s/d
____________________________________________________________
Task List sorted based on deadline
```
**Examples of Exception Handling for this command** (Shreyas)
> Using the sort functionality with the s/ parameter
```
_____________________________________________________________________________________
sort p
Certain Parameters are missing!
_____________________________________________________________________________________
```  

### 4.1.13. Exiting EZ Manager: `bye`

After a hard day's work, you can end your session with EZ Manager using the bye command. Fret not, when you are ready to
resume work, EZ Manager will automatically load the previous data into your session so that you can pick up where you 
left off.
